    <h4>In Defense of the Poor Image</h4>
   <pre>
     The idea of “focus” in Woody Allen’s film stood out to me as an example of what the poor image represents. 
     Value placement held by a selected few in cinema who determine what good or high quality is versus poor quality. 
     “Focus is identified as a class position, a position of ease and privilege, while being out of focus lowers one’s values as an image.” 
     The character in the film is an actor but because his face appears as low resolution he isn’t desired for many roles.
